## Introduction

The **PythonPostgresContainerStarter** project aims to streamline the process of starting a Python project that interacts with a PostgreSQL database using Docker containers. It offers a pre-configured environment that includes both a Python container and a PostgreSQL container, allowing you to focus on developing your Python application without worrying about setting up the database infrastructure.

## Features

- Pre-configured Docker setup for Python and PostgreSQL.
- Project directory for organizing your Python application files.
- Automatic container execution upon starting the project.
- A simple example demonstrating database connectivity and interaction.

## Getting Started

To begin your Python project with PostgreSQL using containers, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/PythonPostgresContainerStarter.git
```


2. Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd PythonPostgresContainerStarter
```


3. Install Docker and Docker Compose if not already installed on your system.

4. Start the containers:

```
docker-compose up
```


5. Access your Python application from the `project` directory and the PostgreSQL database from the `postgres-db-volume` directory.

## Usage

The project structure includes two main directories:

- **app**: Place your Python application files here. The `main.py` file serves as an entry point for your application and is executed whenever the containers start.

- **db**: This directory contains the PostgreSQL data files and configuration. You can further customize the PostgreSQL setup in the `docker-compose.yml` file under the `db` service.

## Customization

Feel free to customize the `Dockerfile` to match your application's requirements. Additionally, modify the `docker-compose.yml` file to adjust container names, ports, environment variables, and more.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you encounter issues, want to enhance the project, or improve the documentation, please open an issue or submit a pull request.

When contributing, ensure that your changes align with the project's goals and guidelines. Also, update the documentation to reflect any significant modifications.
